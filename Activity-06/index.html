            <h3 class="heading">Crafting</h3>
                <p><strong>Crafting</strong> is more than just a hobby—it’s a way to express your personality and creativity. Whether you’re a beginner or an expert, making DIY projects allows you to put your personal touch on every detail. One of the most fun and meaningful projects you can try is making your own flower card. It’s simple, beautiful, and perfect for any occasion.</p>

                <p>Flower cards are great for birthdays, thank-you notes, or just to brighten someone’s day. The design may look complicated, but with some careful folding and measuring, you’ll be surprised at how easy it is. Using materials like <em>cardstock, pencil, and ruler</em>, you can create stunning shapes and patterns that pop out when the card is opened.</p>

                <p>The best part about this project is how customizable it is. You can choose your own colors, patterns, and even add personal messages or embellishments. A little <b>glitter</b> or a decorative sticker can go a long way. If you want to make it extra special, try using textured paper or watercolor effects to give it a unique flair.</p>

                <p>As you work through the steps, remember that it’s okay to make mistakes. That’s how you learn and improve. Even if your first card doesn’t come out perfect, the effort and time you’ve put into it will still be appreciated. <i>Handmade gifts</i> always carry more heart and meaning than store-bought ones.</p>

                <p>One tip to keep in mind is to always score your folds carefully. This makes the card easier to shape and helps prevent tearing. Using a scoring tool or the back of a butter knife works well if you don’t have special craft tools. Clean folds and precise lines can really elevate your card’s final look.</p>

                <p >Finally, don’t forget to have fun. DIY projects like this are meant to be relaxing and enjoyable. Whether you’re making one card or a whole batch, crafting is a therapeutic way to unwind and focus on something positive. You might even find yourself inspired to design more projects after this!</p>
                
                <h3 class="heading">Steps</h3>
                    <ol id="steps">

                        <li>Using a pencil add a <em>vertical</em> and <em >horizontal</em> equal part guide lines.</li>
                        <li>Add a horizontal line with a 3cm gap from horizontal center line. </li>
                        <li>Add a guide line or markings like on image below. This will serve as your reference points later.</li>
                        <li>Connect the points or dots to make a diagonal lines. Start with the blue dots then yellow dots like on the image below.</li>
                        <li>Extend the lines on the paper. These lines will serve as guide to make a curve lines later on.</li>
                        <li>Score and fold the all <em>blue lines.</em></li>
                        <li>Fold the paper in 1/4. You need to use any round objects with a 6cm diameter as your guide to draw a curve. Follow the placement of the curve on the image below.</li>
