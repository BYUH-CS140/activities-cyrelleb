        <p><strong>Char Siu (BBQ Pork)</strong> is a beloved Cantonese dish known for its sweet and savory glaze and tender texture. Made from marinated pork that’s roasted until caramelized, it gets its signature red hue from a mix of hoisin sauce, honey, soy sauce, and five-spice powder. The result is a flavorful, slightly sticky meat that’s often sliced and served with rice or noodles. Char Siu is a staple in Hong Kong-style barbecue shops and a must-try for meat lovers.

        <p><strong>Chicken Feet (Fung Zao)</strong> Chicken feet, or Fung Zao, are a popular dim sum delicacy in Hong Kong and across southern China. Steamed and then braised in a flavorful black bean and garlic sauce, the feet become tender and gelatinous. While it might seem unusual to some, chicken feet are cherished for their unique texture and the rich, savory flavor they absorb during cooking. It’s a traditional comfort food and a symbol of culinary curiosity and appreciation for all parts of the animal.

        <p><strong>Cheung Fun (Rice Noodle Rolls)</strong> Cheung Fun is a silky, delicate rice noodle roll commonly found in dim sum restaurants. Typically filled with shrimp, beef, or char siu, the rolls are steamed to perfection and served with a sweet soy sauce drizzle. Their soft, slippery texture pairs beautifully with the light yet flavorful sauce, making them a favorite breakfast or brunch item. Cheung Fun showcases the elegance of Cantonese cooking through its simplicity and subtle taste.
